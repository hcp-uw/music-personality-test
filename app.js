// This is an example of an "end point" for the backend we are building.
// '/' means that just going to "localhost:5000" will output this endpoint.
// (req, res) is a shorthand (request, response), technically the two arguments can be anything like (a, b) but
// we tend to use (req, res) for clarity.
//
// Request: What we received. for example, the website could give us a username and password which a user typed in.
// These "things" the website gives us will be in JSON format.
//
// Response: What we give back to the website. For example, If we continue the request example, we would connect to a
// database in this end point and see if the user name and password a user has provided to the website is valid or not.
// Then if it is valid, we would "respond" to the website and say that the credentials are correct.
//
// Res Status: These are the "status" of the end point. This is where things like error 404 comes from.
// Since status 404 is "Not Found". There are a lot of status but we can keep with the basics and generally will
// only use 200, some 400s, and 500.
// To learn more, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status
//
// Res Send: Actual content to send back to website. It can be anything: bool, string, or JSON.
//
// Res End: It means we are done with this end point. We shouldn't interact with the website after writing this.

// This is another example of an "end point".
// You can connect to this end point by going to "localhost:5000/person/ANY_NAME"
// For example I can do "localhost:5000/person/sam" or "localhost:5000/person/ben".
// The :name inside the get method is saying that :name is a parameter and can be access from the
// request parameter like I did on line 45.
